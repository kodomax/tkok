//  > Red: If not killed in 3 seconds, disappears and strengthens Broodmother, giving her additional damage and attack speed

//  > Blue: If not killed in 3 seconds, causes spikes to appear, causing 200 damage per hit and stunning. Spikes last forever, but do not move.

// Karrix UVX
// UVX Notes:
//  > Condition: Comes in two modes: Lesser UVX and True UVX. For either UVX, never overlap the sand zones that Karrix will summon behind his tail during the poison phases (less than 500 distance between the centers is considered overlapping).
//  > For Lesser UVX, allow Karrix to spawn 5 sandzones during the first phase. No sandzones are required in other phases. Relic droprate is reduced by 80% for Lesser UVX.
//  > For True UVX, allow Karrix to spawn 5 sandzones in the first, third, and final phases.
//  > You will know if UVX is successfully activated if Karrix shows a special message after the 1st phase: "You cannot handle this! You're not strong enough!".
//  > At the start of the fight, a "Spikes of Malice" will appear and constantly follow a player.  This spike must remain following a player for the entire fight.  You CANNOT let it hit a pillar; if it hits a pillar, it will cause a wipe.  Spike does 600 dmg if it hits a player, and it will change targets whenever Karrix's phase changes.
//  > He'll throw 5 balls of poison instead of 1, all at a single player with a small delay in between each one.
//  > During his tunnelling/"I come for you" phase, he'll create shockwaves around him that deal heavy damage.  During the 4th phase, he'll also summon many more (10+) mini scorpions than normal
//  > In addition to spawning sand zones behind the boss, every time a mini scorpion is killed it will leave behind a sand zone at the spot of death
//  > Starting from the third phase, a slow-moving wall of spikes will move in a circle around the outer edge of the arena, this does slightly under 130 damage per hit, for several hits
//  > During the final phase, spikes will constantly impale all players every 3 seconds (this cannot be dodged), dealing 120 damage and stunning for 1 second
//  > Upon Karrix's death, the room will become sealed and start to collapse. All players must take the loot, open the door (stand on the two switches that will appear) and exit north to Ancient Orc Tomb within 25 seconds or die.

//  > Minions will appear during link phase every 4 seconds as well as when he gains Frostbite stacks, these should be killed as they spawn (Mana Fiends with reduced HP can spawn here, so DPS should take care)
//  > Karnos will start emitting frost bolts randomly around him as he gains Frostbite stacks, these deal 500 damage and inflict a stack of Bitter Cold (the same debuff that causes you to get frozen at 8 stacks)
//  > After reaching the UVX condition, Karnos is instantly healed to 70% HP (if he is below 70%), damage reduction is changed from 90% to 70% and phase 2 begins.
//  > You will know if Karnos reaches the condition when he shouts a special message: "My power is spreading!"
//  > In Phase 2, a random player will be chased by an ice mirage. If the ice mirage touches its target, the target dies. The ice mirage can be killed, but it will slowly accelerate faster and faster, and it will leave ice blocks in its path as obstacles. One ice mirage will appear every 20 seconds.
//  > Upon death, all players are frozen for 10 seconds and suffer 150 pure damage per second.
